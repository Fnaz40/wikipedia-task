    <p>A<strong>flower</strong>, sometimes known as a <strong>bloom</strong>or <a href="text"><strong>
                blossom</strong></a>, is the <a href="text"> reproductive</a> structure found in <a href="text">
            flowering plants</a> (plants of the
        division <a href="text"> Magnoliophyta</a>, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to
        effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate
        outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of
        sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce<a href="text"> diaspores </a>without fertilization (<a
            href="text"> parthenocarpy</a>). Flowers contain<a href="text"> sporangia</a> and are the site where <a
            href="text"> gametophytes</a> develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause
        them to be vectors for the transfer of <a href="text">pollen</a>. After fertilization, the <a href="text">
            ovary</a> of the flower develops into <a href="text"> fruit</a> containing<a href="text"> seeds.</a></p>
    <p>In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by
        humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual,<a href="text"> religion,
            medicine</a> and as a source of food.</p>

    <h2>Morphology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Floral parts</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>The essential parts of a flower can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of petals and
        associated structures in the perianth, and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower consists of
        four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk. Each of these kinds of parts is arranged in a <a
            href="text">whorl</a> on <a href="text">receptacle</a>. The four main whorls (starting from the base of the
        flower or lowest node and working upwards) are as follows:</p>
    <h3>Perianth</h3>
    <p><em>Main articles: <a href="text">Perianth, Sepal</a> and <a href="text">Corolla (flower)</a></em></p>
    <p>Collective the calyx and corolla form the <a href="text"> perianth </a> (see diagram)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em><a href="text">Calyx</a></em>: the outermost whorl consisting of units called <em><a href="text">
                    sepals;</a> </em>these are typically green and enclose the rest of the flower in the bud stage,
            however, they can be absent or prominent and petal-like in some species.</li>
        <li><em><a href="text">Corolla</a></em>:the next whorl toward the apex, composed of units called<em> <a
                    href="text">petals,</a></em> which are typically thin, soft and colored to attract animals that help
            the process of <a href="text"> pollination</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reproductive</h3>
    <img src="images/330px-Ranunculus_glaberrimus_labelled.jpg" alt="image">
    <em>Main articles: <a href="text">Plant reproductive morphology, Androecium</a>and <a href="text">Gynoecium</a></em>
    <ul>
        <li><em><a href="text">Androecium</a>(from Greek andros oikia</em>: man's house): the next whorl (sometimes
            multiplied into several whorls), consisting of units called <a href="text">stamens</a>. Stamens consist of
            two parts: a stalk called a <a href="text">filament</a>, topped by an <a href="text"> anther</a> where <a
                href="text">pollen</a> is produced by meiosis and eventually dispersed.</li>
        <li><em><a href="text">Gynoecium</a></em> (from Greek <em>gynaikos oikia:</em> woman's house): the innermost
            whorl of a flower, consisting of one or more units called carpels. The <a href="text"> carpel </a> or
            multiple fused carpels form a hollow structure called an ovary, which produces ovules internally. Ovules are
            megasporangia and they in turn produce megaspores by meiosis which develop into female gametophytes. These
            give rise to egg cells. The gynoecium of a flower is also described using an alternative terminology wherein
            the structure one sees in the innermost whorl (consisting of an ovary, style and stigma) is called a <a
                href="text">pistil</a>. A pistil may consist of a single carpel or a number of carpels fused together.
            The sticky tip of the pistil, the stigma, is the receptor of pollen. The supportive stalk, the style,
            becomes the pathway for <a href="text">pollen tubes</a> to grow from pollen grains adhering to the stigma.
            The relationship to the gynoecium on the receptacle is described as<strong>hypogynous</strong> (beneath a
            superior ovary),<strong>perigynous</strong> (surrounding a superior ovary), or<strong>epigynous</strong>
            (above inferior ovary).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Structure</h3>

            Main parts of a mature flower (<a href="text">Ranunculus glaberrimus</a>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <img src="images/220px-Lillium_Stamens.jpg" alt="image">
    <p>Although the arrangement described above is considered "typical", plant species show a wide variation in floral
        structure. <a href="text"><sup>[1]</sup></a> These modifications have significance in the evolution of flowering
        plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species</p>
    <p>The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their
        function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions and/or look like what is
        typically another part. In some families, like <a href="text">Ranunculaceae,</a> the petals are greatly reduced
        and in many species the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are
        petal-like; the double flowers of <a href="text"> Peonies</a> and <a href="text">Roses</a> are mostly petaloid
        stamens. <a href="text"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Flowers show great variation and plant scientists describe this
        variation in a systematic way to identify and distinguish species.</p>
    <p>Specific terminology is used to describe flowers and their parts. Many flower parts are fused together; fused
        parts originating from the same whorl are <a href="text"><strong>connate</strong></a>, while fused parts
        originating from different whorls are <a href="text"><strong>adnate</strong></a>; parts that are not fused are
        <strong>free</strong>. When petals are fused into a tube or ring that falls away as a single unit, they are
        sympetalous (also called <strong>gamopetalous</strong>). Connate petals may have distinctive regions: the
        cylindrical base is the tube, the expanding region is the throat and the flaring outer region is the limb. A
        sympetalous flower, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is<strong> bilabiate</strong>. Flowers
        with connate petals or sepals may have various shaped corolla or calyx, including campanulate, funnelform,
        tubular, urceolate, salverform or rotate.</p>
    <p>Referring to "fusion," as it is commonly done, appears questionable because at least some of the processes
        involved may be non-fusion processes. For example, the addition of intercalary growth at or below the base of
        the primordia of floral appendages such as sepals, petals, stamens and carpels may lead to a common base that is
        not the result of fusion. <a href="text"><sup>[3][4][5]</sup></a></p>
    <p>Many flowers have a symmetry. When the <a href="text">perianth</a> is bisected through the central axis from any
        point and symmetrical halves are produced, the flower is said to be <a href="text">actinomorphic </a> or
        regular, e.g. rose or trillium. This is an example of <a href="text">radial symmetry</a>. When flowers are
        bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or <a
            href="text">zygomorphic,</a> e.g. snapdragon or most orchids.</p>
    <p>Flowers may be directly attached to the plant at their base (sessile—the supporting stalk or stem is highly
        reduced or absent). The stem or stalk subtending a flower is called a <a href="text">peduncle.</a> If a peduncle
        supports more than one flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called <a
            href="text">pedicels.</a> The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the
        <em>torus</em> or receptacle.</p>
    <h3>Inflorescence</h3>
    <img src="images/inflore.png" alt="image">
    <em>Mian article: <a href="text">Inflorescence</a></em>
    <p>In those species that have more than one flower on an axis, the collective cluster of flowers is termed an <a
            href="text"><em>inflorescence</em></a>. Some inflorescences are composed of many small flowers arranged in a
        formation that resembles a single flower. The common example of this is most members of the very large composite
        (Asteraceae) group. A single <a href="text">daisy</a> or <a href="text">sunflower</a>, for example, is not a
        flower but a flower <a href="text"> head</a>—an inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets). An
        inflorescence may include specialized stems and modified leaves known as <a href="text">bracts</a>.</p>
    <h3>Floral digrams and floral formulae</h3>
    <img src="images/floral dig.png" alt="image">
    <em>Main article: <a href="text">Floral formula</a> and <a href="text">Floral digram</a> </em>
    <p>A <em>floral formula</em>is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers and
        symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form. It can represent a <a
            href="text">taxon</a>, usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species.
        Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since. Prenner et al.
        (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula. <a
            href="text"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The format of floral formulae differs in different parts of the world, yet
        they convey the same information. <a href="text"><sup>[7][8][9][10]</sup></a></p>
    <p>The structure of a flower can also be expressed by the means of <a href="text"><em>floral diagrams</em></a>. The
        use of schematic diagrams can replace long descriptions or complicated drawings as a tool for understanding both
        floral structure and evolution. Such diagrams may show important features of flowers, including the relative
        positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and symmetry, as well as structural details.
        <a href="text"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical <a href="text">meristem</a> (determinate
        meaning the axis grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant
        morphology are interpreted as highly modified <a href="text">leaves.<sup>[11]</sup></a> Detailed developmental
        studies, however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like <a href="text">modified
            stems</a> (caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble branchlets. <a href="text"><sup>[5][1]</sup></a>
        Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of flowering plants, we find a
        continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots). <a
            href="text"><sup>[12][13]</sup></a></p>
    <h4>Flowering transition</h4>
    <p>The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The
        transition must take place at a time that is favorable for <a href="text">fertilization</a> and the formation of
        <a href="text"> seeds</a>, hence ensuring maximal <a href="text"> reproductive </a>success. To meet these needs
        a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of <a
            href="text"> plant hormones</a> and seasonable <a href="text">temperature</a> and <a href="text">
            photoperiod </a>changes. <a href="text"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Many <a href="text">perennial </a> and most <a
            href="text">biennial</a> plants require <a href="text">vernalization</a> to flower. The molecular
        interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as <a href="text">
            florigen</a>, which involves a variety of genes, including Constans, Flowering Locus C and Flowering Locus
        T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in <a href="text">buds</a>
        and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes. <a
            href="text"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>
    <p>The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia.
        This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues
        into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or
        flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem
        end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and <a href="text">carpels</a>. Once this
        process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start
        of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. <a href="text"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Once
        the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.</p>
    <p><a href="text">Yvonne Aitken</a> has shown that flowering transition depends on a number of factors, and that
        plants flowering earliest under given conditions had the least dependence on climate whereas later-flowering
        varieties reacted strongly to the climate setup.</p>
    <h4>Organ development</h4>
    <img src="images/develp.png" alt="image">
    <em>Main article: <a href="text">ABC model of flower development</a> </em>
    <p>The molecular control of floral organ identity determination appears to be fairly well understood in some
        species. In a simple model, three gene activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine the
        developmental identities of the organ primordia within the floral <a href="text">meristem</a>. These gene
        functions are called A, B and C-gene functions. In the first floral whorl only A-genes are expressed, leading to
        the formation of sepals. In the second whorl both A- and B-genes are expressed, leading to the formation of
        petals. In the third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the flower C-genes alone
        give rise to carpels. The model is based upon studies of mutants in <a href="text"><em>Arabidopsis
                thaliana</em></a> and snapdragon, <a href="text"><em>Antirrhinum majus</em></a>. For example, when there
        is a loss of B-gene function, mutant flowers are produced with sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in
        the second whorl instead of the normal petal formation. In the third whorl the lack of B function but presence
        of C-function mimics the fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also in the third whorl.</p>
    <p>Most genes central in this model belong to the <a href="text">MADS-box</a> genes and are <a
            href="text">transcription factors</a> that regulate the expression of the genes specific for each floral
        organ.</p>
    <h3>Floral function</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="images/fun.png" alt="image">
    <em>See also <a href="text">Plant reproductive morphology</a> </em>
    <p>The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the individual and the species. All flowering plants are
        <em>heterosporous</em>, producing two types of <a href="text">spores</a>. Microspores are produced by meiosis
        inside anthers while megaspores are produced inside ovules, inside an ovary. In fact, anthers typically consist
        of four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into
        gametophytes inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores
        (are endosporic).</p>
    <p>In the majority of species, individual flowers have both functional carpels and stamens. Botanists describe these
        flowers as being perfect or bisexual and the species as <a href="text"><em>hermaphroditic</em></a>. Some flowers
        lack one or the other reproductive organ and called imperfect or unisexual. If unisex flowers are found on the
        same individual plant but in different locations, the species is said to be <em><a
                href="text">monoecious</a></em>. If each type of unisex flower is found only on separate individuals,
        the plant is <a href="text"><em>dioecious</em></a>.</p>
    <h3>Flower specialization and pollination</h3>
    <em>Further information: <a href="tex">Pollination syndrome</a></em>
    <p>Flowering plants usually face selective pressure to optimize the transfer of their <a href="text">pollen</a>, and
        this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behaviour of the plants. Pollen may be
        transferred between plants via a number of 'vectors'. Some plants make use of abiotic vectors — namely wind (<a
            href="text">anemophily</a>) or, much less commonly, water (<a href="text">hydrophily</a>). Others use biotic
        vectors including insects (<a href="text">entomophily</a>), birds (<a href="text">ornithophily</a>), bats ( <a
            href="text">chiropterophily</a>) or other animals. Some plants make use of multiple vectors, but many are

    <p> <a href="text">Cleistogamous flowers</a> are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not open. Many Viola
        and some Salvia species are known to have these types of flowers</p>
    <p>The flowers of plants that make use of biotic pollen vectors commonly have glands called <a
            href="text">nectaries</a> that act as an incentive for animals to visit the flower. Some flowers have
        patterns, called <a href="text">nectar guides</a>, that show pollinators where to look for nectar. Flowers also
        attract pollinators by scent and color. Still other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of
        orchids, for example, produce flowers resembling female bees in color, shape, and scent. Flowers are also
        specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the <a href="text">stamens</a> that ensures that pollen grains
        are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar,

        having a number of long filaments terminating in exposed stamens, and the female flowers having long,
        feather-like stigmas. Whereas the pollen of animal-pollinated flowers tends to be large-grained, sticky, and
        rich in <a href="text">protein</a> (another "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is usually
        small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to animals.</p>
    <h3>Pollination</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="images/ploli.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
    <em>Main article: <a href="text">Pollinatin</a></em>
    <p>The primary purpose of a flower is <a href="text">reproduction</a>. Since the flowers are the reproductive organs
        of plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules — contained in the
        ovary. Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma. The joining of the sperm to the
        ovules is called fertilization. Normally pollen is moved from one plant to another, but many plants are able to
        self pollinate. The fertilized ovules produce seeds that are the next generation. Sexual reproduction produces
        genetically unique offspring, allowing for <a href="text">adaptation</a>. Flowers have specific designs which
        encourages the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. Many plants are dependent upon
        external factors for pollination, including: wind and animals, and especially <a href="text">insects</a>. Even
        large animals such as birds, bats, and <a href="text">pygmy possums</a> can be employed. The period of time
        during which this process can take place (the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called anthesis. The
        study of pollination by insects is called <a href="text"><em>anthecology</em></a>.</p>
    <h3>Pollination mechanism</h3>
    <img src="images/plooin.png" alt="image">
    <p>The pollination mechanism employed by a plant depends on what method of pollination is utilized.</p>
    <p>Most flowers can be divided between two broad groups of pollination methods:</p>
    <p><em>Entomophilous:</em> flowers attract and use insects, bats, birds or other animals to transfer pollen from one
        flower to the next. Often they are specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that
        pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as
        nectar, pollen, or a mate). In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator
        transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits. Many
        flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination. Others, such as the <a
            href="text">Sarracenia</a> or <a href="text">lady-slipper orchids</a>, have elaborate designs to ensure
        pollination while preventing <a href="text">self-pollination</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Anemophilous:</em> flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next, examples include the <a
            href="text">grasses</a>, Birch trees, Ragweed and Maples. They have no need to attract pollinators and
        therefore tend not to grow large blossoms. Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers tends to be
        large-grained, sticky, and rich in <a href="text">protein</a> (another "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous
        flower pollen is usually small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to <a
            href="text">insects</a>, though it may still be gathered in times of dearth. Honeybees and bumblebees
        actively gather anemophilous corn (<a href="text">maize</a>) pollen, though it is of little value to them.</p>
    <p>Some flowers with both stamens and a pistil are capable of self-fertilization, which does increase the chance of
        producing seeds but limits genetic variation. The extreme case of self-fertilization occurs in flowers that
        always self-fertilize, such as many <a href="text">dandelions</a>. Some flowers are self-pollinated and use
        flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open, these flowers are called <a
            href="text">cleistogamous</a>. Many Viola species and some Salvia have these types of flowers. Conversely,
        many species of plants have ways of preventing self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same
        plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing
        its ovules. The latter flower types, which have chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as
        self-sterile or self-incompatible.</p>
    <h3>Attraction methods</h3>
    <img src="images/attract.png" alt="image">
    <p>Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved to attract animals to transfer
        pollen between individuals in dispersed populations. Flowers that are insect-pollinated are called
        <em>entomophilous</em>; literally "insect-loving" in Greek. They can be highly modified along with the
        pollinating insects by <a href="text">co-evolution</a>. Flowers commonly have glands called nectaries on various
        parts that attract animals looking for nutritious <a href="text">nectar</a>. <a href="text">Birds</a> and <a
            href="text">bees</a> have color vision, enabling them to seek out "colorful" flowers.</p>
    <p>Some flowers have patterns, called <a href="text">nectar guides</a>, that show pollinators where to look for
        nectar; they may be visible only under <a href="text">ultraviolet</a> light, which is visible to bees and some
        other insects. Flowers also attract pollinators by <a href="text">scent</a> and some of those scents are
        pleasant to our sense of smell. Not all flower scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are
        pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals, often
        called <a href="text">Carrion flowers</a>, including <a href="text"><em>Rafflesia</em></a>, the <a
            href="text">titan arum</a>, and the North American <a href="text">pawpaw</a> <em>(Asimina triloba)</em>.
        Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract
        pollinators and most such flowers are white.</p>
    <p>Other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of orchids, for example, produce flowers
        resembling female bees in color, shape, and scent. Male bees move from one such flower to another in search of a
        mate.</p>
    <h3>Flower-pollinator relationships</h3>
    <p>Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating organisms. Many flowers, for
        example, attract only one specific species of insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful
        reproduction. This close relationship is often given as an example of <a href="text">coevolution</a>, as the
        flower and pollinator are thought to have developed together over a long period of time to match each other's
        needs.</p>
    <p>This close relationship compounds the negative effects of <a href="text">extinction</a>. The extinction of either
        member in such a relationship would mean almost certain extinction of the other member as well. Some <a
            href="text">endangered plantspecies</a> are so because of <a href="text">shrinking pollinator
            populations</a>.
        <h3>Pollen allergy</h3>
        <P>There is much confusion about the role of flowers in allergies. For example, the showy and entomophilous <a
                href="text">goldenrod</a><em>(Solidago)</em> is frequently blamed for <a href="text">respiratory
                allergies</a>, of which it is innocent, since its pollen cannot be airborne. The types of pollen that
            most commonly cause allergic reactions are produced by the plain-looking plants (trees, grasses, and weeds)
            that do not have showy flowers. These plants make small, light, dry pollen grains that are custom-made for
            wind transport.</P>
        <p>The type of allergens in the pollen is the main factor that determines whether the pollen is likely to cause
            hay fever. For example, pine tree pollen is produced in large amounts by a common tree, which would make it
            a good candidate for causing allergy. It is, however, a relatively rare cause of allergy because the types
            of allergens in pine pollen appear to make it less allergenic. Instead the <a href="text">allergen</a> is
            usually the pollen of the contemporary bloom of anemophilous <a href="text">ragweed</a> <em>(Ambrosia)</em>,
            which can drift for many miles. Scientists have collected samples of ragweed pollen 400 miles out at sea and
            2 miles high in the air. <a href="text"><sup>[17]</sup></a> A single ragweed plant can generate a million
            grains of pollen per day. <a href="text"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>
        <p>Among North American plants, weeds are the most prolific producers of allergenic pollen. <a
                href="text"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Ragweed is the major culprit, but other important sources are sagebrush,
            redroot pigweed, lamb's quarters, Russian thistle (tumbleweed), and English plantain.</p>
        <p>It is common to hear people say they are allergic to colorful or scented flowers like roses. In fact, only
            florists, gardeners, and others who have prolonged, close contact with flowers are likely to be sensitive to
            pollen from these plants. Most people have little contact with the large, heavy, waxy pollen grains of such
            flowering plants because this type of pollen is not carried by wind but by insects such as butterflies and
            bees.</p>

        <img src="images/evol.png" alt="image">
        <em>Further information: <a href="text">Evolution of flowers</a> and <a href="text">Floral biology</a></em>
        <p>While land plants have existed for about 425 million years, the first ones <a href="text">reproduced</a> by a
            simple adaptation of their aquatic counterparts: <a href="text">spores</a>. In the sea, plants—and some
            animals—can simply scatter out genetic clones of themselves to float away and grow elsewhere. This is how
            early plants reproduced. But plants soon evolved methods of protecting these copies to deal with drying out
            and other damage which is even more likely on land than in the sea. The protection became the <a
                href="text">seed</a>, though it had not yet evolved the flower. Early seed-bearing plants include the <a
                href="text">ginkgo</a> and <a href="text">conifers</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="images/pera.jpeg" alt="image"> groups of extinct gymnosperms, particularly <a href="text">seed
                ferns</a>, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil
            evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. The apparently sudden appearance of relatively modern flowers
            in the fossil record posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an "abominable
            mystery" by <a href="text">Charles Darwin</a>.</p>
        <p>Recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil
            gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. An early
            fossil of a flowering plant, <a href="text"><em>Archaefructus liaoningensis</em></a> from China, is dated
            about 125 million years old. <a href="text"><sup>[20][21]</sup></a> Even earlier from China is the 125–130
            million years old <a href="text"><em>Archaefructus sinensis</em></a>. In 2015 a plant (130 million-year-old
            <a href="text"><em>Montsechia vidalii</em></a>, discovered in Spain) was claimed to be 130 million years
            old. <a href="text"><sup>[22]</sup></a> In 2018, scientists reported that the earliest flowers began about
            180 million years ago. <a href="text"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>
        <p><img src="images/new.png" alt="image">Recent <a href="text">DNA</a> analysis (<a href="text">molecular
                systematics</a>) <a href="text"><sup>[24]</sup></a> shows that Amborella trichopoda, found on the
            Pacific island of New Caledonia, is the only species in the <a href="text">sister group</a> to the rest of
            the flowering plants, and morphological studies suggest that it has features which may have been
            characteristic of the earliest flowering plants. <a href="text"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
        <p>Besides the hard proof of flowers in or shortly before the <a href="text">Cretaceous,<sup>[26][27]</sup></a>
            there is some circumstantial evidence of flowers as much as 250 million years ago. A chemical used by plants
            to defend their flowers, <a href="text">oleanane</a>, has been detected in fossil plants that old, including
            <a href="text">gigantopterids,<sup>[28]</sup></a> which evolved at that time and bear many of the traits of
            modern, flowering plants, though they are not known to be flowering plants themselves, because only their
            stems and prickles have been found preserved in detail; one of the earliest examples of <a
                href="text">petrification</a>.</p>
        <p>The similarity in <a href="text">leaf</a> and <a href="text">stem</a> structure can be very important,
            because flowers are genetically just an adaptation of normal leaf and stem components on plants, a
            combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots. <a href="text"><sup>[29]</sup></a> The
            most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but
            in contact with) each other. The flowers would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be <a
                href="text">bisexual</a> (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to
            be dominated by the <a href="text">ovary</a> (female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations
            developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes
            per flower or plant, or at least "ovary inferior".</p>
        <p>The general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve animals in the
            reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without bright colors and obvious shapes, which would
            therefore be a liability, using the plant's resources, unless they provide some other benefit. One proposed
            reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they evolved in an isolated setting
            like an island, or chain of islands, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized
            relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop today.
            This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen from one plant to another much the way
            <a href="text">fig wasps</a> do today, could have eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their
            partners developing a high degree of specialization. <a href="text">Island genetics</a> is believed to be a
            common source of <a href="text">speciation</a>, especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem
            to have required inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, apparently
            evolved specifically for symbiotic plant relationships, are descended from wasps. </p>
        <p>Likewise, most <a href="text">fruit</a> used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the
            flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering
            the seeds it contains.</p>
        <p>While many such <a href="text">symbiotic relationships</a> remain too fragile to survive competition with
            mainland organisms, flowers proved to be an unusually effective means of production, spreading (whatever
            their actual origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life.</p>
        <p>Flower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans
            that many of them cannot be pollinated in nature. Many modern, domesticated flowers used to be simple weeds,
            which only sprouted when the ground was disturbed. Some of them tended to grow with human crops, and the
            prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty, developing a dependence upon and special adaptation
            to human affection. <a href="text"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/boo.png" alt="image"><br>
        <p><img src="images/coolo.png" alt="image">Many flowering plants reflect as much light as possible within
            the range of visible wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract. Flowers that reflect the
            full range of visible light are generally perceived as <a href="text"><em>white</em></a> by a human
            observer. An important feature of white flowers is that they reflect equally across the visible spectrum.
            While many flowering plants use white to attract pollinators, the use of color is also widespread (even
            within the same species). Color allows a flowering plant to be more specific about the pollinator it seeks
            to attract. The color model used by human color reproduction technology (<a href="text">CMYK</a>) relies on
            the modulation of pigments that divide the spectrum into broad areas of absorption. Flowering plants by
            contrast are able to shift the transition point wavelength between absorption and reflection. If it is
            assumed that the visual systems of most pollinators view the visible spectrum as <a href="text">circular</a>
            then it may be said that flowering plants produce color by absorbing the light in one region of the spectrum
            and reflecting the light in the other region. With CMYK, color is produced as a function of the amplitude of
            the broad regions of absorption. Flowering plants by contrast produce color by modifying the frequency (or
            rather wavelength) of the light reflected. Most flowers absorb light in the blue to yellow region of the
            spectrum and reflect light from the green to red region of the spectrum. For many species of flowering
            plant, it is the transition point that characterizes the color that they produce. Color may be modulated by
            shifting the transition point between absorption and reflection and in this way a flowering plant may
            specify which pollinator it seeks to attract. Some flowering plants also have a limited ability to modulate
            areas of absorption. This is typically not as precise as control over wavelength. Humans observers will
            perceive this as degrees of saturation (the amount of<em>white</em> in the color).</p>

        <p>Flowers provide less food than other major plant parts (<a href="text">seeds, fruits, roots, stems</a> and <a

    <h3>Flower-giving</h3>
    <p>The flower-giving tradition goes back to prehistoric times when flowers often had a medicinal and herbal
        attributes. Archaeologists found in several grave sites remnants of flower petals. Flowers were first used as
        sacrificial and burial objects. <a href="text">Ancient Egyptians</a> and later Greeks and Romans used flowers.
        In Egypt, burial objects from the time around 1540 BC<sup>[<a href="text">citation needed</a>]</sup> were found,
        which depicted <a href="text">red poppy</a>, yellow Araun, cornflower and lilies. Records of flower giving
        appear in <a href="text">Chinese writings</a> and Egyptian hieroglyphics, as well as in <a href="text">Greek</a>
        and <a href="text">Roman mythology</a>. The practice of giving a flower flourished in the Middle Ages when
        couples showed affection through flowers.</p>
    <p>The tradition of flower-giving exists in many forms. It is an important part of <a href="text">Russian
            culture</a> and folklore. It is common for students to give flowers to their teachers. To give yellow
        flowers in a romantic relationship means break-up in Russia. Nowadays, flowers are often given away in the form
        of a <a href="text">Flower bouquet.<sup>[46][47][48][49]</sup></a></p>
